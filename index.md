# Muaid Mughrabi

## Intro
Hi! My name is Muaid. I am currently a Master's student of Computer Science at [Leibniz University Hannover](https://www.uni-hannover.de/en/). The focus of my studies is [Data Science](https://www.et-inf.uni-hannover.de/de/studium/im-studium/informatik-m-sc/themenschwerpunkte-im-master-informatik/#c39815). In **December 2021**, I will complete my master's degree.

During my study, I focused on developing my skills in three main directions: **Data Science and Artifical Intellegence**, **Software Engineering**, and, to a leeser extend, **Human-Computer Intraction**. This was mainly done by focusing on career development not only in terms of academia, but also in terms of industry. Previously I worked at [Bosch](https://www.bosch.de/unser-unternehmen/bosch-in-deutschland/hildesheim/) (2019), [StarFinanz](https://www.starfinanz.de) (The IT service provider of the Sparkassen Finance Group) (2019-2021). Currenlty, I am working at [TNG Technology Consulting](https://www.tngtech.com/en/index.html) in the [Cloud Data Hub](https://data.bmwgroup.com/) project in behalf of [BMW](https://www.bmw.com/en/index.html). 

## Skills
In general:
* Data Science and Artifical Intellegence: my main interest and the main course of my studies. This includes **Data Analysis**, **Visualisation**, usage of **Machine and Deep Learning** algorithms to solve problems related to *Natural language processing*, *graph data analysis*, *multimedia processing*, and *deploying smart agents using reinforcement learning*.

* Software Engineering Skills: skills related to creating high quality but still easy to maintain softwares.

<progress style="width:96%; left: 0px;" value="80" max="100"> </progress>

* Softskills: teamwork, leadership skills, knowledge transfer. I worked as a academic tutor for more than 10 different academic courses addressed to different disciplinary backgrounds.

## Honorable Projects
 
* **Bachelor Thesis: Design of Multi Channel EMS Notifications and their Effects on the User Experience** (Submitted 01.2019)**:**

    Challenges among three dimensions:

    1. *Software Development*: creating a high-quality EMS framework capable of communicating with multiple EMS channels simultaneously, which was then used to create a user-friendly IDE and a study execution tool, all within a very limited timeframe.  
    2. *Human Computer Interaction*: creating and conducting 2 user studies. In Addition, pattern creation requires prior knowledge of human anatomy.
    3. *Data Analysis*: drawing conclusions from the collected data and presenting them in a visually appealing way. 

    Used technlogies:  
    Java, JavaFX, C, Gson, [let your body move](https://bitbucket.org/MaxPfeiffer/letyourbodymove/wiki/Home), Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

    More details can be found [here](https://hci.uni-hannover.de/theses).

* [CheXpert](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/):

    International competition introduced by Stanford ML Group aiming at automated interpretation of chest radiographs. With my group, we reached and held the **first place** (also **internationally**) for the single model competition for about 1 month (06.2019), currently ranked 94th for single and ensamble models (model name: JustAnotherDensenet). 
    
    <!-- toDo: challenges with bigData and logistics, CI\CD -->

* Other Academic Projects:
    * [Deep Learning Project: ](https://gitlab.com/mydo.mughrabi/graphsage) This Project replicates, extends and evaluates the well known [GraphSAGE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02216.pdf) algorithm. 

    * [Datamining Project: ](https://gitlab.com/omar.araboghli/cost-sensitive-boosting) This work aims to reproduce and explain the results of the cost-sensitive boosting approaches presented [here](https://sci2s.ugr.es/keel/pdf/specific/articulo/sun2007a.pdf).
