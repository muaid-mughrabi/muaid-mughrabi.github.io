# Muaid Mughrabi

## Intro
Hi! My name is Muaid. I am currently a Master's student of Computer Science at [Leibniz University Hannover](https://www.uni-hannover.de/en/). The focus of my studies is [Data Science](https://www.et-inf.uni-hannover.de/de/studium/im-studium/informatik-m-sc/themenschwerpunkte-im-master-informatik/#c39815). In **December 2021**, I will complete my master's degree.

During my study, I focused on developing my skills in three main directions: **Data Science and Artifical Intellegence**, **Software Engineering**, and, to a leeser extend, **Human-Computer Intraction**. This was mainly done by focusing on career development not only in terms of academia, but also in terms of industry. Previously I worked at [Bosch](https://www.bosch.de/unser-unternehmen/bosch-in-deutschland/hildesheim/) (2019), [StarFinanz](https://www.starfinanz.de) (The IT service provider of the Sparkassen Finance Group) (2019-2021). Currenlty, I am working at [TNG Technology Consulting](https://www.tngtech.com/en/index.html) in the [Cloud Data Hub](https://data.bmwgroup.com/) project in behalf of [BMW](https://www.bmw.com/en/index.html). 

## Skills
In general:
* Data Science and Artifical Intellegence: my main interest and the main course of my studies. This includes **Data Analysis**, **Visualisation**, usage of **Machine and Deep Learning** algorithms to solve problems related to *Natural language processing*, *graph data analysis*, *multimedia processing*, and *deploying smart agents using reinforcement learning*.

## Honorable Projects
 
* **Bachelor Thesis: Design of Multi Channel EMS Notifications and their Effects on the User Experience** (Submitted 01.2019)**:**

    Challenges among three dimensions:

    1. *Software Development*: creating a high-quality EMS framework capable of communicating with multiple EMS channels simultaneously, which was then used to create a user-friendly IDE and a study execution tool, all within a very limited timeframe.  
    2. *Human Computer Interaction*: creating and conducting 2 user studies. In Addition, pattern creation requires prior knowledge of human anatomy.
    3. *Data Analysis*: drawing conclusions from the collected data and presenting them in a visually appealing way. 

    Used technlogies:  
    Java, JavaFX, C, Gson, [let your body move](https://bitbucket.org/MaxPfeiffer/letyourbodymove/wiki/Home), Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

* [CheXpert](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/):

    International competition introduced by Stanford ML Group aiming at automated interpretation of chest radiographs. With my group, we reached and held the first place (also internationally) for the single model competition for about 1 month (06.2019), currently ranked 94th for single and ensamble models (model name: JustAnotherDensenet). 

* Other Academic Projects:
    * Deep Learning Project

    * Datamining Project
